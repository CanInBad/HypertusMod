[b]WARNING: This contains hyper stuff, if you dislike it then leave[/b]
This mod [color=yellow][u][b]adds[/b][/u][/color] bodyparts that are infused with "Bluespace anomalies" that enhance them enough to become unstable size wise.

The "Bluespace anomalies" in question can be activated with a skill tree that added by this mod.

To gain the tree's experience, you have to invest some points in to vanilla perks.

[u][b]Some or all perks might be hidden due to incompatible bodyparts!!![/b][/u]

There is no story in this version yet, but the perks and bodyparts might not break in the future

Only the player can get it at this time and I might not make it spawn with dynamic NPC

Has compatibility layer between these mods:
 - Synth Species
 - Knotted Horse Cock
 - Fluffy Bodyparts
 - Avali Species (both version)
 - Ace's Aviary Addon

if you have any feedback send it in #mods-discussion and ping me
