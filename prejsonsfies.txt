[b]WARNING: This contains hyper stuff, if you dislike it then leave[/b]
This mod [color=yellow][u][b]adds[/b][/u][/color] bodyparts that are infused with "Bluespace anomalies" that enhance them enough to become unstable size wise.

The "Bluespace anomalies" in question can be activated with a skill tree that added by this mod.

To gain the tree's experience, you have to invest some points in to vanilla perks.

[u][b]Some or all perks might be hidden due to incompatible bodyparts!!![/b][/u]

There is no story in this version yet, but the perks and bodyparts might not break in the future

Only the player can get it at this time

Has compatibility layer between these mods:
 - Synth Species
 - Knotted Horse Cock
 - Fluffy Bodyparts
 - Avali Species (both version)
 - Ace's Aviary Addon
 - Transgender Flat Chest
