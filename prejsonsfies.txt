This mods [b]adds[/b] [i](not replace)[/i] new body parts that just like the normal ones but you can upgrade them in a new skill tree that came with this mod. Said body parts are in form of breast, penises, vagina, and anus. 
The mod also have capability layers that use the looks of your favorite body parts/species mod that add one of the 4 body part categories mentioned.

You gain experience points of said skill tree by invest in vanilla perks and then sleep, each time you wake up you will be notified how much of them you get. 
You can then spend those point to add ridiculous amount of perks to your body parts. 

There is a draft of the story but it isn't complete in anyway and some glimpse of it can be read in the perks' description.

If you want to play Hypertus in your current save (not recommended), you have to enable debug mode and change bodyparts that you want a hyperable version of.

Has compatibility layer between these mods:
 - Synth Species
 - Knotted Horse Cock
 - Fluffy Bodyparts
 - Avali Species (both version)
 - Ace's Aviary Addon
 - Transgender Flat Chest
