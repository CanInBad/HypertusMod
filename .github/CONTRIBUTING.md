## ISSUEs

### Submitting an issue

If you have the problem with the project, search the issue if it already existed. If a related issue doesn't exist you can then open an issue.

Before submitting an issue make sure to add prefix to the name properly. Like for example: Requesting a feature, you must add prefix `[FEATURE REQUEST]`. and for bugs you must add prefix `[BUG]`

***DO NOT* ADD MULTIPLE THINGS AT ONCE**, like putting suggestion and reporting a bug in the same issue

## PULL REQUESTs

### Making changes

Make sure that the title of pull request must be gist of what contain inside the pull request, if there is too much detail, I recommend putting suffix `[read desc]`
